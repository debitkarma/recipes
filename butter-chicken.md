# Butter Chicken

Butter chicken (Hindi: murgh makhani /moorgh MUH-khuh-nee/, lit. 'butter chicken') is an iconic recipe from Old Delhi. Its a pretty brilliant way to deal with leftover proteins and give them some new life. It has a similar consistency to Chicken Tikka Masala, but has very little heat (if at all) and a few other differences in base flavor profile.

#### Goals
1. Breakdown a general technique for Butter Chicken
1. Discuss why Butter Chicken works and touch on its history
1. Outline some popular substitutions that can be made
    - Gram flour (Besan or chickpea flour) is used in the marinade to create a crust on the chicken as it dries and cooks, not unlike cornflour in chinese stir frys or AP flour in dredges.
    - Cooking out the flour makes it super nutty and savory
    - If you need to substitute, use AP flour, and use finely grated parmesan.
    - Parmesan mimics the umami from nutty chickpea flour! GREAT substitute, or even an upgrade.
1. Highlight cheats to make this mid-week friendly
  - Freezing sauce at different stages
  - Using store-bought/ready-to-eat proteins
  - Having sides ready to go
1. Plan mise en place
1. Eyeball some recipe amounts
1. Discuss core unskippable ingredients
